# Violet Moon Modding

This is the GitHub organization for Violet Moon, a team established in 2011 that produces high-quality Minecraft
mods and modpacks. You can learn more about us on our [website](https://violetmoon.org/).

Here you can find all the upstream repositories for our various mods. Some of our projects also have a presence on [SourceHut](https://sr.ht/~williewillus/violet-moon/).

You can also find older mods from before we were called Violet Moon on the [Archive repo](https://github.com/VazkiiModsArchive).

## Signing
In the near future, releases of our mods will start to be accompanied by `.asc` PGP

# Violet Moon Modding

This is the GitHub organization for Violet Moon, a team established in 2011 that produces high-quality Minecraft
mods and modpacks. You can learn more about us on our [website](https://violetmoon.org/).

Here you can find all the upstream repositories for our various mods.

## Announcements
To keep up with Violet Moon, you can follow us on the following channels:

The Twitter and Discord tend to be more active, while the mailing list will contain more high-signal announcements, usually just release announcements for mods.
